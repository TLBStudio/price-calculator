# Project Description

TLB Pricing is a web-based project estimation tool built with Symfony 7.3 and modern frontend technologies.

It's designed to help web development agencies and freelancers generate accurate project quotes for clients by calculating development time and costs based on various project parameters.

## Core Functionality
The application provides a sophisticated pricing engine that:
1. Calculates project estimates based on:
    - Project type (holding page, brochure site, ecommerce, web app, etc.)
    - Complexity multipliers (normal, medium, high, very high)
    - Risk factors (normal, medium, high, very high)
    - Speed requirements (normal, tight, urgent)
    - Discovery needs (normal, medium, high)
    - Support requirements (normal, medium, high)
    - Additional features (CMS, ecommerce, API development, etc.)

2. Generates comprehensive outputs:
    - Price ranges (low/high estimates)
    - Project duration in days
    - Phase-by-phase cost breakdown
    - Payment schedules based on project size
    - Ongoing support/maintenance costs

3. Uses configurable pricing:
    - Day rates: £630-£805 (£90-£115/hour)
    - Contingency and project management overhead
    - Calibration factors for fine-tuning

## Business Value
This is a highly valuable tool for agencies that:

- Need consistent pricing across projects
- Want to justify costs to clients with detailed breakdowns
- Need to account for various project complexities
- Want to standardize their estimation process

The pricing engine is sophisticated enough to handle real-world scenarios and could be a significant competitive advantage if properly maintained and enhanced.


## Technical Architecture
Backend: Symfony 7.3 with PHP 8.2+
- Clean MVC architecture with dedicated PricingEngine service
- Form handling with EstimateType form class
- YAML-based configuration for pricing rules
- Doctrine ORM ready (though no entities currently implemented)

Frontend: Modern web stack
- Tailwind CSS 4.1 for styling
- Stimulus.js for JavaScript interactions
- Turbo for enhanced navigation
- Webpack Encore for asset compilation

Infrastructure:
- Docker support with compose files
- PHPStan for static analysis
- PHP CS Fixer for code formatting
- PHPUnit for testing (though no tests currently written)

## Feedback & Recommendations

Strengths

1. Well-structured architecture: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated service layer
2. Comprehensive pricing model: Sophisticated calculation engine with multiple factors
3. Modern tech stack: Using latest Symfony 7.3 and modern frontend tools
4. Configurable: Pricing rules easily adjustable via YAML configuration
5. Professional UI: Clean, responsive interface with Tailwind CSS

Areas for Improvement

1. Missing Tests: No unit or integration tests found - critical for a pricing tool
2. No Data Persistence: Currently stateless - no way to save estimates or track history
3. Limited Validation: Form validation could be enhanced with business rules
4. No User Management: Single-user application without role-based access
5. Missing Documentation: No API documentation

Immediate Recommendations

1. Add Testing: Start with unit tests for PricingEngine service
2. Create Entities: Add Doctrine entities for estimates, clients, and projects
3. Enhance Validation: Add business rule validation (e.g., minimum project values)
4. Add History: Implement estimate storage and retrieval
5. Document setup, usage, and configuration

Technical Debt

1. Commented Code: Unused integrations code in PricingEngine
2. Hardcoded Values: Some magic numbers in calculations could be configurable
3. Missing Error Handling: No error handling for invalid configurations
4. Frontend Assets: Minimal JavaScript - could benefit from more interactive features
